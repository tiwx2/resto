# Resto

This is a web application that enables users to brows nearby restaurants and keep a list of favorited ones.

## Context

The following project is in response to the Hidden Founders challenge (description [here](https://github.com/hiddenfounders/mobile-coding-challenge "Hidden Founders Challenge"))

## Progress

The app satisfies the minimum requirements for the challenge and have been hosted on DigitalOcean (description [here](http://206.189.164.226/ "resto"))

## To Do
Still missing:
  * Email verification upon sign up.
  * Admin panel (where one can add/edit restaurants)
  * Restaurant page (You can only see a restaurant's card and not a full profile)
  * Rating system
  * Other thing (Open to suggestions...)
